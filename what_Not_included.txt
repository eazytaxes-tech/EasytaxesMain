# Gap Analysis: Implementation vs Content.txt (Updated)

## Global / General
- **External Subdomains vs Internal Routes**: The "Home - Service Lines Grid" section in `content.txt` lists subdomains (e.g., `resolution.eazytaxes.com`), but the code implements internal routes (e.g., `/tax-resolution`). This is consistent with detailed page specs and modern SPA architecture. ✅ **Accepted Departure**.

## Home Page (https://eazytaxes.com)
- **Hero Sections**: 
  - Spec: "No secondary CTA needed on hero for now". ✅ **Resolved** (Only "Get Started" present).
  - Intro Text: Needs slight alignment with spec ("Eazytaxes Inc. is a US-based professional services firm..."). Current: "US tax, compliance, and advisory services...".
- **Section 6 - Credentials/Positioning Strip**: 
  - Spec: "US-based professional services firm · Cross-border and domestic matters · Project-based and ongoing engagements".
  - Current: Missing or partially covered in "About Us" rotating taglines.

  - Current: Partially covered in footer and hero, but could be more explicit.

  - Current: "Ready to scale your business?", Button "Get Started". (Close enough, but text differs).

## Tax & Compliance Page (/tax-compliance)

## Summary
The project has reached a high level of conformity with `content.txt`. Most major content blocks (Trust bars, process sections, comparison tables, and FAQs) have been implemented across all service pages. The primary remaining tasks involve subtle text refinements on the Home page to strictly match the spec's mission statement and credentials positioning.
